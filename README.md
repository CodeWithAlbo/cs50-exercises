# ðŸ’» CS50-Exercises

This repository documents my personal journey through [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), one of the most respected computer science courses in the world.

Iâ€™m not just taking the course â€” Iâ€™m understanding it deeply and documenting everything along the way.

## ðŸ“š Structure

The repo is organized by week. Each week contains:

- `README.md`: Overview of that week's topic
- `XX_Progress.md`: What I learned, with notes and examples
- `XX_Reflection.md`: Deeper thoughts, realizations, and connections

## âœ… Completed So Far

- Week 0 â†’ âœ…  
Covering Binary, Bits, Bytes, ASCII, Unicode, RGB, Images, Sound, and more.

> Letâ€™s finish CS50 like it owes us money.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Complete CS50 and document it all  
- Build a solid Computer Science foundation  
- Use this as a launchpad for future learning and opportunities

ðŸ“Œ **Work in progress.** Updates happen every time I study.

Feel free to follow along or fork if you're taking CS50 too!
