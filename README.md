# 💻 CS50-Exercises

This repository documents my personal journey through [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), one of the most respected computer science courses in the world.

I’m not just taking the course — I’m understanding it deeply and documenting everything along the way.

## 📚 Structure

The repo is organized by week. Each week contains:

- `README.md`: Overview of that week's topic
- `XX_Progress.md`: What I learned, with notes and examples
- `XX_Reflection.md`: Deeper thoughts, realizations, and connections

## ✅ Completed So Far

- **Week 0 🖥️**
  Covering Binary, Bits, Bytes, ASCII, Unicode, RGB, Images, Sound, Algorithms, Pseudocode, and Artificial Intelligence.
  
- [00_Intro.md](Week0/00_Intro.md) – Core concepts: computational thinking, problem solving, and abstraction.
- [01_Progress.md](Week0/01_Progress.md) – Binary, bits, bytes, ASCII, Unicode deep dive.
- [02_Reflection.md](Week0/02_Reflection.md) – Notes and realizations on the basics.
- [03_Media.md](Week0/03_Media.md) – RGB, Images, Videos, and Sound (aka why my photos are huge lol).
- [04_Algorithms.md](Week0/04_Algorithms.md) – Sorting out how fast (or slow) different solutions can be.
- [05_Pseudocode.md](Week0/05_Pseudocode.md) – How to write down logic before even touching code.
- [06_AI.md](Week0/06_AI.md) – Baby steps into AI and why LLMs are the real deal.

## 🚀 Goals

- Complete CS50 and document it all  
- Build a solid Computer Science foundation  
- Use this as a launchpad for future learning and opportunities

📌 **Work in progress.** Updates happen every time I study.
