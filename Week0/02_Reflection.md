# Week 0 – Reflection (Part 2)

I wasn’t planning to continue the CS50 video.  
I was supposed to take a break and come back after the weekend.

But I didn't pause.

Something about this content made me want to keep going — not because I had to, but because I genuinely wanted to understand more.

##  From ASCII to Unicode

I learned that ASCII — with its 8-bit, 256-character limit — was no longer enough to express all human languages.

So we created **Unicode**, which uses 16, 24, or even 32 bits per character to cover:
- All modern languages
- Ancient scripts
- Symbols
- Emoji
- …and even things we haven’t invented yet

And the best part?  
**It’s backwards compatible** with ASCII.  
The first 256 characters remain exactly the same — Unicode just builds on top of it.

##  Realization

What started as “one more video segment” became a deep dive into how computers actually represent human communication.

I’m starting to realize —  
**this isn’t just code. It’s language. It’s logic. It’s legacy.**

And I’m here for it.
