#  Week 0 â€“ Artificial Intelligence: The Basics

Ok sooo we dipped our toes into AI and yeah, itâ€™s basically logic on steroids.

###  What I Got from This:
- You can program basic AI by writing **tons of conditionals** (if/else if/elseâ€¦ repeat forever ðŸ˜…).
- But real AI = **LLMs (Large Language Models)** that learn from MASSIVE datasets. Not just dumb conditionals.
- These models **predict** what should come next in a sentence or a convo based on patterns in data.

### ðŸ”¨ Example of "baby AI" pseudocode:
If student says hello:
Say hello
Else if student says goodbye:
Say goodbye
Else if student says how are you:
Say well
Else if student asks why 111 in binary is 7 in decimal:
Say "because it is "


###  Real Talk:
- AI is **super useful**, but for this course?  No cheating with ChatGPT or anything else (except CS50â€™s own AI helper ðŸ‘‰ [CS50.ai](https://cs50.ai)).
- AI isnâ€™t *magic* â€“ itâ€™s code thatâ€™s been trained to look smart. The more I learn, the more I see that.

In short: AI = next-level problem-solving, but it all starts with basic logic and pseudocode. Baby steps till we build our own Skynet ðŸ˜¤.
