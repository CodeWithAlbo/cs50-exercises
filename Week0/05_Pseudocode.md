Alright, so here’s the deal: before you even *touch* real code, you gotta know wtf you’re trying to do. That’s where pseudocode comes in.

 Pseudocode = writing down step-by-step what you want the computer to do, but in plain English (or whatever language you speak).

David said it clear: there’s no one "correct" way to write pseudocode. The point is to **think like a computer** and break down your solution into small, clear steps.

###  Why It Matters:
- Helps you *think* before you code.
- Shows others (and future you) the logic behind your code.
- Forces you to spot mistakes early (trust me, they’re there).

###  What It Looks Like:
Example from the phone book search:

Pick up phone book
Open to middle of phone book
Look at page
If person is on page:
 Call person
Else if person is earlier in book:
Open to middle of left half
 Go back to step 3
Else if person is later in book:
Open to middle of right half
 Go back to step 3
Else:
 Quit

 
###  Key Concepts:
- **Functions:** steps like "pick up," "open," "look at."
- **Conditionals:** if, else if, else.
- **Boolean expressions:** true/false checks (like “person is earlier in book”).
- **Loops:** repeating steps (like “go back to step 3”).

In short: pseudocode is your game plan. Don’t skip it if you don’t wanna rage-quit later 😂.
