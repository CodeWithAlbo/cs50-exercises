# Week 0 – Scratch

Welcome to the beginning of my CS50 journey.  
This week focused on foundational concepts like:
- Computational thinking
- Problem solving
- Abstraction
- Algorithms

## Project: Scratch  
*(Coming soon – project in development)*

- ## Notes:
- Computers only do what you tell them — nothing more, nothing less.
- Good code is clear, logical, and reusable.
- Scratch might look like a toy, but the logic behind it is powerful.

Let’s build something real. One week at a time.
