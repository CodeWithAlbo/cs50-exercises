- [`01_Progress.md`](./01_Progress.md) – Key takeaways and realizations about binary, bits, and bytes.
- [`02_Reflection.md`](./02_Reflection.md) – Deeper thoughts on ASCII, Unicode, and the emotional rollercoaster of learning.
- [`03_Media.md`](./03_Media.md) – How computers represent RGB colors, pixels, video, and sound.
- [`04_Algorithms.md`](./04_Algorithms.md) – Algorithm strategies, efficiency, and Big-O notation explained.
- [`05_Pseudocode.md`](./05_Pseudocode.md) – What pseudocode is, how to write it, and why it’s your best friend before coding.
- [`06_AI.md`](./06_AI.md) – Diving into artificial intelligence: from basic if/else to machine learning vibes.
