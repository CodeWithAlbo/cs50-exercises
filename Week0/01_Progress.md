# Week 0 – Progress Report

##  What I’ve Learned So Far

- Computer Science isn't just about writing code — it's about solving real-world problems through structured thinking.
- Every program is essentially: **Input → Logic → Output**.
- Computers only understand **binary**, a language made up of 0s and 1s.
- A **bit** is a single light switch: OFF (0) or ON (1).
- **Binary** uses powers of 2.  
  Example: `1011` = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = **11**
- **1 byte = 8 bits** → 256 possible values (0 to 255)

##  What Stood Out

- David Malan brings *energy*, *clarity*, and an actual desire to help you grow.
- Most CS50 students start with **zero CS background** — and that made me feel confident starting from scratch.
- This course isn’t just about C or Python. It’s about **learning how to learn**.

##  Personal Reflection

I’ve been studying development at a school where it took us nearly **a full month** to reach the kind of binary clarity I achieved here in just **two hours**.

> That says more about the power of CS50 and the clarity of structured learning than it does about me.

Still, it hit me — I **can do this**.  
Not because it's easy, but because I finally care enough to go all in.

##  Status

I’ve completed half of Week 0.  
I’m traveling for a few days, but I’ll be back Saturday night to continue this journey and finish what I started.

Let’s keep going.
